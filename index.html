                    How my notes are structured:

                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <h3>Match 1 : Mirage</h3>
                <p>Starting T side</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Tec9 smoke, accidentally dropped the smoke instead of throwing it and movement mistake trying when you rethrow it, and at the end accidentally wasted it as by the time you threw it all the enemies were dead so maybe slightly more awareness as to the likely enemy positions. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 armour, nice window smoke and good movement, but when engaging the enemy jungle you peeked as you fell off the wood in window which caused you to miss some shots, I don’t recommend closing the distance and then reloading your weapon as this gives the enemy a chance to peek you more easily, also instead of holding the likely position after you reloaded you immediately dropped a grenade which meant if the enemy went to peek you after the reload you would have been defenceless, interesting position outside of deathhole on the box and good job catching the enemy off-guard but a bit of unfortunate timing meant you took some damage. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice middle take and good aggression but after you have taken middle I recommend a more unified response as in the end you tried to take A almost alone which led to you taking an unfavourable fight, although the enemy did hit a good shot. W</li>
                    <li>Galeil buy, nice window smoke and good job moving up catwalk and being aware of positions that could damage you, although you got slightly overly confident when you saw it was a scout on short and you closed the distance only to be met with a deagle. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, Nice movement into palace but I would recommend a slightly different pathing, unfortunate positioning led to you not being focused on a push which they exploited by catching you off guard and closing the distance with a five-seven which killed you. L</li>
                    <li>full save, a bit of dangerous movement into middle as taking that fight without a weapon was a waste of time with the glock as you do like zero damage even if you dink them, so I would have waited till they were closer or like you did eventually do pickup the weapon of a teammate which was good, and good use of utility to try and reduce the number of angles but you peeked before it could pop which actually worked against you as you were not ready for someone to peek window which is how you died. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 armour, {{timeout}} nice b rush and good decision regarding weapons, but as the last player it would have been super beneficial if you had gotten 1 flash as it would have helped your players who moved in first, good job getting the plant unfortunately you peeked the enemy cat from a very predictable angle and he was able to counter quite effectively which meant he did a significant amount of damage to you before you could even react, unfortunately, your teammate killed you in this situation. L</li>
                    <li>CT side: pistol kit and 2 flashes, unfortunate timing on rotating short as the enemies had talked into apps and got a very good timing on you, I think if you had a little more patience and waited slightly longer this round would have had a different outcome if you spotted them. L</li>
                    <li>Five-seven armour, good attempt at a palace rush but you didn’t do the push as I generally recommend this led to the enemy hearing you and they were ready for you so when they peeked and surprised you they had a huge advantage and killed you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good apps jump spotting technique, no-action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, jump spotting again, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, wasted molly apps as you didn’t see anyone, good flash into middle blinding the enemy chair but I would have recommended playing a more off-angle as you went back to a more common angle so he was ready for the fight after you went back short, good job dinking him unfortunately he did the same with the AK. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, a bit of a slow rotate from B, nice pathing into connector but not focusing on smokes fading led to you dying to an enemy sitting in one. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, B protocols are a bit lacking as the way you were moving around and using utility would have meant if they did push B you would have been caught out in the open. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Match 2 : Mirage</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Tec-9 smoke, an interesting choice not to buy body armour and instead go with tec-9 and smoke, during this round because you had no body armour you died to one revolver shot. L</li>
                    <li>Ak no head armour, During second round I exclusively recommend buying head armour as there is no other round with a higher chance of the enemies using SMGS or Pistols which would both one hit headshots you, but fortunately you didn’t die after being dinked through a teammate and managing to get 2 kill on 5hp is very impressive. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice window smoke and good backup flashes from Spawn to sell the mid take, you went for the plant in default and the enemy had a lineup which they got you through the CT smoke. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, bad pathing in palace meant the enemy could peek you easily, unfortunately, you did not buy headarmour again and when he dinked you with the smg it did significant damage and gave you a lot of aimpunch which basically made you lose that fight instantly. L</li>
                    <li>full save, good job getting close to the enemy but your mistake in palace was running to peek him which alerted him to your position instead if you would have waited for him to push further in and he would have because he is greedy and confident, you would have had an easier time doing more damage and lining up a headshot. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, Nice A execute with the team, although as the top stairs smoker I would recommend asking the CT smoker to do the lamp flashes and dropping them at his feet although this requires good communication, when you got onto site you instantly went for the plant even with a bad CT smoke, so I would have recommended clearing site first and then getting a teammate to hold CT while you plant the bomb. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle armour, good job spotting the 1-way molly in window, but because its a 1-way it was incredibly difficult to see through the molly and this gave him the advantage, generally speaking if you see a 1-way of any kind don’t challenge it even if you know what they are doing as they are designed to be hard to shoot back through. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice window smoke, good eye for potential danger and spotting weird smokes, unfortunate flash movement into CT which made a good play into a bad obvious one which the enemies were able to quickly counter. W</li>
                    <li>CT side: Kit and double flashes, good kill on the enemy coming up connector, and solid attempt at using a flash but it didn’t work out as it was quite obvious, unfortunate goosh from the second enemy connector which killed you. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, very quick A rotate which was good but you took an extremely dangerous path through middle where an enemy was waiting for you which led to you taking over 80 damage without being able to shoot back at all, that in combination with the overly aggressive play onto A solo meant you died almost instantly instead of waiting for a proper retake attempt. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, Nice roate onto B from short to split the site but you were not focused on the possible enemy positions so when you came up short so when the enemy peeked you normally you were not ready for him. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Solid positioning on A but your Hyper-focus on palace when your buddy CT could only just hold ramp meant you were completely exposed and would probably die before you teammate could get the trade on you, let your teammate focus on palace from CT as they can’t directly damage you unless they spam or molly you, when rotating to B you were not focused on the possible positions the enemies could be in so when you went through jungle and the enemy was snipers nest it caught you completely off-guard giving him a huge advantage in that fight. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, nice off-angle on default and interesting flash site, but unfortunately, you peeked the overly exposed side which showed you to anyone coming out ramp, although you managed to get a kill if you had peeked the other side it would have been safer.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How did your crosshair placement feel? <br> Probably okay at some points but probably not good </li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during flicks?  <br> flicks felt very inconsistent </li>
                    <li>How did your overall aim mechanics feel, like spraying, preaiming, peeking angles ect? <br> Pretty awful just losing a lot of fights and thinking the enemies were aiming better than me.</li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel? <br> I was unsure when to rotate and I was just trying to guess when to rotate. </li>
                    <li>How did your positioning feel? <br>I probably chose bad positions and often put myself in disadvantageous positions.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br> Most of the time I threw effective utility and flashed the best I could. </li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving correct information? <br> Yea I believe so. </li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>First game they were not talkative and during the second game not really a good mood</li>
                    <li>Looking back now what do you think you could immediately improve on for the next game? <br> Probably aim and the way I was taking fights</li>
